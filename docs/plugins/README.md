# [Docs](/docs/README.md) / Plugins
Plugins are the backbone of FurAffiniTweaks. They power all of the modifications that make the extension matter, and are flexible in a way plugins from other extensions (like *Vencord* for Discord) usually aren't.

Some plugins depend and extend on one another, and some plugins listen for events from other plugins in order to create a seamless experience with nearly zero hitches.

This is a good place to learn about how to make plugins, how to extend on other plugins, and how to further shape FurAffinity in ways never seen before on any other website.
